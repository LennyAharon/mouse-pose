Build _raw/kaufman's top-level CollectedData.csv / CollectedData_test.csv from its
104 per-session CollectedData_Hank.csv files (labeled-data/<timestamp>-cam[12]/).

The source is already standard DLC format (project.yaml, labeled-data/, images all
present) -- each session dir just has its own CSV instead of one combined project-level
CSV, so this script's only job is to concatenate all 104 and split. No image copying is
needed (everything already lives at its final _raw/kaufman/ path).

kaufman is a calibrated multi-view source (shared calibration.toml, cam1/cam2 covering
the same trials) but is being built as a SINGLE-view dataset here per an explicit user
decision -- cam1 and cam2 sessions are kept as independent rows, not merged into one
multi-view sample.

Split is by subject, using the mouse-to-session mapping the user supplied at
_raw/_dlc/kaufman/labeled-sessions-mouse-date-time.txt (one "<mouse>/<timestamp>" per
line, e.g. "b8sSM5/20241208-125516"). By explicit user decision, b8sSM7 and b8sSM10 are
held out entirely for test and everything else (b8sSM5, b8sSM6, b8sSM8, b8sSM9) is
train -- not a random/percentage split. Splitting by subject (rather than by individual
labeled-data dir) also keeps a session's cam1 and cam2 views -- the same trial, viewed
twice -- on the same side of the split, since treating them as unrelated would leak
near-duplicate frames across train/test.

`videos/` and `videos_test/` were already reorganized by hand to match this subject
split (all b8sSM7/b8sSM10 sample videos in videos_test/, the rest in videos/) -- this
script only handles CollectedData.csv / CollectedData_test.csv, not video placement.

Usage:
